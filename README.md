### Commit!

- When you make changes on JupyterLab they will appear in GitHub Desktop, you can commit to your branch as often or as little as you like!
- We use GitHub for version control - so a commit with a descriptive comment every time a new feature is added is very useful for development.
- When you work on a project with others, individual branches are often dedicated to each collaborator and what they are working on - GitHub provides functionality to merge these together at the end of development.
